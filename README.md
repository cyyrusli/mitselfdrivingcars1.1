# MIT Self Driving Cars Competition Version 1.1
My javascript code that I submitted for MIT's 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars competition version 1.1 (DeepTraffic). I have uploaded two sets of code, one is pre-trained and one is after training.

I was able to achieve a best result of 75.40mph (average result was +- 0.3mph)at the time of writing and is currently tied at Rank 2-3 after training my AI for around 21hours.

For this version I used a larger neural network compared to the previous version.
